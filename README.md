Hey folks! 👋

My name is Tim (he/him). I'm an data engineer and developer advocate who finds himself living too much in the gray area between job functions most days. I do what it takes to give people what they need in order to give others what they need. Let me know if you ever want to talk about:
- data pipelines 🛠
- analytics 📈
- documentation 📚
- data strategy 🙃
- previously clinical decision support 🏥
- or cats 🐈
