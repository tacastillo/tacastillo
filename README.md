Hey folks! 👋

My name is Tim (he/him). I'm an analytics engineer who finds himself living too much in the gray area between job functions most days. I do what it takes to give people what they need in order to give others what they need. Let me know if you ever want to talk about:
- data pipelines 🛠
- analytics 📈
- feature engineering 🧬
- clinical decision support 🏥
- data visualization 🌲
- documentation 📚
- change management 🙃
- or cats 🐈
